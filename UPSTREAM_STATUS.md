# Upstream status

This repository contains an out-of-tree Projects UX plugin for OpenClaw.

Upstream (openclaw/openclaw) policy requires issue-first discussion for non-trivial UX additions.
A prior PR was closed by maintainer automation, and a follow-up issue was closed as **not planned**.

Accordingly, this work is maintained **out-of-tree** due to upstream scope/roadmap constraints.
